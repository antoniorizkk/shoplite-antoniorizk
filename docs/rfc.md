## AI Touchpoints

I am proposing two near-term AI touchpoints (Typeahead and Support assistant). See the capability map and details: `/docs/ai-first/ai-capability-map.md`. The design focuses on low integration risk (uses catalog, FAQ markdown, and the existing `order-status` API), concrete p95 latency targets, and a small cost model to validate feasibility.
